        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>TeachBot was born from a simple observation: teachers are overworked, 
           under-supported, and expected to meet increasingly complex demands.
           We believe educators deserve smart tools that lighten the load and amplify their impact.<br>
           Founded by a passionate developer and education enthusiast, TeachBot is committed to solving 
           real problems faced by teachers—starting with lesson planning and classroom support.

        <h1>Meet The Founder</h1>
        <p>Wandile Ndlovu is a passionate software developer and certified TEFL teacher from Johannesburg, South Africa,
           driven by the belief that technology should empower—not replace educators. After spending time teaching English,
           Wandile experienced first-hand the challenges teachers face, especially those working full-time in physical classrooms.
           This sparked a deeper appreciation for how AI could meaningfully support lesson planning, engagement, and time management. 
           With a background in web development and a growing passion for artificial intelligence, Wandile created TeachBot in response 
           to the urgent need for smarter, simpler teaching tools that truly serve the educator.
